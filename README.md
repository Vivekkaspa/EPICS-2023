                  Spelling errors in written text can significantly impact the credibility and accuracy of the message being conveyed.          

      Detecting and correcting spelling errors is a crucial task, especially for applications that require high-quality written communication. This project aims to implement a spelling checker and corrector using a graphical user interface (GUI) that can detect and suggest corrections for spelling errors in a given text.It uses the Damerau-Levenshtein algorithm calculates the minimum number of insertions, deletions, substitutions, and transpositions needed to transform one word into another and suggests corrections for misspelled words. The Spelling correction implementation is done using Python Tkinter and involves trigram probability model.This model is used to estimate the probability of a given word or sequence of words appearing in the language on a large corpus of text ,stores the computed probabilities and then use for correcting the spellings based on the context. This probability analysis will help improve the accuracy of  the spell checker by suggesting the most likely correct word based on the context in which it appears. Real world spelling errors can also be corrected by the help of trigram probability model to some extent.

               The ultimate goal of this mini project is to create a reliable and efficient spell checker that can be used in a variety of applications such as word processors, web browsers, and mobile devices.
